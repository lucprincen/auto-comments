/*================= Auto-comments ===================*/

Auto comments allows you to simply add automatic-updating comments to 
your WordPress installation. It uses the Heartbeat API to check for new comments
(in a smart way) and sends back the html if there are any.

This was created by Luc Princen of Chef du Web for the first WordPress Cafe the Netherlands
for the talk "WordPress' Pusle; diving into the Heartbeat API".

/*================= Addendum ===================*/

Lets reinvigorate this bitch. Updates through zip and git.
